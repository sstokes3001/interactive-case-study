    <!-- Chosen Palette: Academic Blue & Gold -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page dashboard with a fixed sidebar for navigation. This structure was chosen to provide users with a constant, clear overview of the available content sections, allowing them to jump between strategic analysis (Dashboard), foundational standards (Frameworks), practical application (Objective Lab, Assessment Studio), and risk management (Pitfalls) without losing context. This non-linear approach transforms the dense report into an accessible, task-oriented tool, enhancing usability for busy program administrators who may need to find specific information quickly. Key interactions include tabbed content, interactive diagrams built with HTML/CSS, and dynamic charts to make data exploration engaging and intuitive. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: ARC-PA Citation Data -> Goal: Highlight compliance risk areas -> Viz/Method: Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Tooltips on hover provide exact citation counts -> Justification: A bar chart is the clearest way to compare the frequency of citations across different standards, immediately drawing attention to the most problematic areas like B4.01a.
        - Report Info: ARC-PA Educational Hierarchy -> Goal: Explain the relationship between competencies, outcomes, and objectives -> Viz/Method: Custom HTML/CSS Flow Diagram -> Interaction: Hovering over each element reveals its definition -> Justification: A visual, interactive diagram is more effective than text for explaining a hierarchical structure, making the relationships tangible and easier to grasp.
        - Report Info: Bloom's Taxonomy -> Goal: Provide a practical tool for writing objectives -> Viz/Method: Interactive Tabbed Component (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Clicking a tab for each cognitive level displays associated action verbs and examples -> Justification: This transforms a static table into an interactive tool, allowing faculty to focus on one cognitive level at a time, which is more practical for curriculum development.
        - Report Info: Miller's Pyramid -> Goal: Align assessment methods with clinical competence levels -> Viz/Method: Custom HTML/CSS Pyramid Diagram -> Interaction: Clicking a level of the pyramid filters a list of appropriate assessment methods -> Justification: This visually connects the theoretical framework to practical assessment choices, reinforcing the principle of constructive alignment.
        - Report Info: Common Pitfalls -> Goal: Teach users to identify and correct errors -> Viz/Method: Interactive "Before & After" Cards (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Toggling a switch reveals the corrected version of a poorly written objective -> Justification: This active-learning approach is more engaging and memorable than simply listing mistakes and corrections.
